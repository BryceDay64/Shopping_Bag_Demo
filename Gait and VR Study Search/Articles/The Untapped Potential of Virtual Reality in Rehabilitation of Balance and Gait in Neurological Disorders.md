**Abstract:**
	Dynamic systems theory transformed our understanding of motor control by recognizing the continual interaction between the organism and the environment. Movement could no longer be visualized simply as a response to a pattern of stimuli or as a demonstration of prior intent; movement is context dependent and is continuously reshaped by the ongoing dynamics of the world around us. Virtual reality is one methodological variable that allows us to control and manipulate that environmental context. A large body of literature exists to support the impact of visual flow, visual conditions, and visual perception on the planning and execution of movement. In rehabilitative practice, however, this technology has been employed mostly as a tool for motivation and enjoyment of physical exercise. The opportunity to modulate motor behavior through the parameters of the virtual world is often ignored in practice. In this article we present the results of experiments from our laboratories and from others demonstrating that presenting particular characteristics of the virtual world through different sensory modalities will modify balance and locomotor behavior. We will discuss how movement in the virtual world opens a window into the motor planning processes and informs us about the relative weighting of visual and somatosensory signals. Finally, we discuss how these findings should influence future treatment design.

**Notes:**
	This article acts as a review article for the effects of virtual reality on gait. It first discusses optic flow and convinces you that vision has a key influence on body positioning and gait. After it has done so using evidence from postural control/rehabilitation studies, it describes the different methods that VR can be used to influence treatment design through manipulation of avatar-based feedback, external cuing, and pedestrian interactions.

**Highlights:**
	- "movement is context dependent and is continuously reshaped by the ongoing dynamics of the world around us"
	- "Studies combining VR as well as other technologies (e.g., motion platform, robotic devices) to mobile neuroimaging can be expected, in the near future, to flourish and advance our understanding of locomotor control in complex, comprehensive yet controlled multisensory environments."
	- "Sensory signals are often reweighted in individuals as they age and with neurological disability, which then alters the postural response to optic flow"
	- "Results suggest that exposure to unpredictable and noisy environments can be a valuable tool for motor rehabilitation."
	- "slower walking speeds are adopted at faster optic flow speeds while faster walking speeds are observed at slower optic flows"
	- "Although these results are preliminary, there is a clear implication that combining sensory modalities yielded the largest improvements in spatial symmetry"
	- "In children with cerebral palsy, for instance, avatar-based feedback was augmented with biofeedback on knee or hip excursion, as well as step length, resulting in further improvements in those parameters compared to avatar based feedback alone"
	- "phenomenon of “gait synchronization”, whereby a follower matches the gait pattern of the leader, can be observed"
	- "While promising as a tool for rehabilitation, however, evidence of effectiveness of external cueing through virtual humans as an intervention either for posture or locomotion remains to be established."
	- "understand the properties of VR technology that create meaningful task constraints such as sensory conflict and error augmentation"
	- "to be successful, immersion in an environment that produces presence and embodiment is necessary if the user is to respond in a realistic way"
