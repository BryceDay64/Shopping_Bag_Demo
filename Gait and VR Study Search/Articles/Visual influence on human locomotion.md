**Abstract:**
	The effect of an optic flow pattern on human locomotion was studied in subjects walking on a selfdriven treadmill. During walking an optic flow pattern was presented, which gave subjects the illusion of walking in a tunnel. Visual stimulation was achieved by a closed-loop system in which optic flow and treadmill velocity were automatically adjusted to the intended walking velocity (WV). Subjects were instructed to keep their WV constant. The presented optic flow velocity was sinusoidally varied relative to the WV with a cycle period of 2 min. The independent variable was the relative optic flow (rOF), ranging from −1, i.e., forward flow of equal velocity as the WV, and 3, i.e., backward flow 3 times faster than WV. All subjects were affected by rOF in a similar way. The results showed, firstly, an increase in stride-cycle variability that suggests a larger instability of the walking pattern than in treadmill walking without optic flow; and, secondly, a significant modulating effect of rOF on the self-chosen WV. Backward flow resulted in a decrease, whereas forward flow induced an increase of WV. Within the analyzed range, a linear relationship was found between rOF and WV. Thirdly, WV-related modulations in stride length (SL) and stride frequency (SF) were different from normal walking: whereas in the latter a change in WV is characterized by a stable linear relationship between SL and SF (i.e., an approximately constant SL to SF ratio), optic flow-induced changes in WV are closely related to a modulation of SL (i.e., a change of SL-SF ratio). Fourthly, this effect of rOF diminished by about 45% over the entire walking distance of 800 m. The results suggest that the adjustment of WV is the result of a summation of visual and leg-proprioceptive velocity informations. Visual information about ego-motion leads to an unintentional modulation of WV by affecting specifically the relationship between SL and  SF. It is hypothesized that the space-related parameter (SL) is influenced by visually perceived motion information, whereas the temporal parameter (SF) remains stable. The adaptation over the entire walking distance suggests that a shift from visual to leg-proprioceptive control takes place.
**Notes:**
	In this article subjects where asked to walk on a self driven treadmill while maintaining a self-selected speed and looking at a half-spherical screen in front of the treadmill. The screen displayed diamonds which flowed past the subject. The speed of the diamonds was varied sinusoidally between a relative optic flow of -1 and 3. The study then measured the walking velocity, stride length, and stride frequency of the subject. This study determined that there is significant linear correlation between the optic flow  and the walking velocity of the subject. This walking velocity was modified primarily by changing the stride length instead of the stride frequency.  This study also showed that there is a significant time-related adaption period to settle into the modified walking velocity (essentially the sinusoidal relative optical flow damps the walking velocity).

**Highlights:**
	- "Konczak (1994) found a direction-specific effect: backward flow induced a decrease in walking velocity, whereas forward flow induced an increase in walking velocity. However, these results were based on the analysis of only a few successive strides, and changes in walking velocity did not show a specific modulation of the relationship between stride length/stride frequency, which was described for visually guided walking"
	- "Subjects walked on a self-driven treadmill. This was technically achieved by a closed-loop control system in which the measurement of subject’s position on the treadmill was used to adjust the treadmill velocity according to subjects’ chosen walking velocity."
	- "shows a clear dependency of walking velocity on relative optic flow, which is primarily due to changes in stride length and not in stride frequency"
	- "However, within the analyzed range of relative optic flow, there was no direction-specific and velocity-specific influence of relative optic flow on the stability of the walking pattern, at least when the change in relative optic flow was brought about slowly."
	- "Backward flow led to a decrease in walking velocity, whereas forward flow led to an increase in walking velocity. Within the analyzed range of relative optic flow the effect on the walking velocity can be described by a linear negative regression function"
