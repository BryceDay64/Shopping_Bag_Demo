**Abstract:**
	The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there are age-related differences in locomotion due to changes in presence of vision, optic flow speed, and lateral flow asymmetry using virtual reality technology. Gait kinematics and heading direction were measured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Although older and younger adults were affected differentially by the availability of vision, a greater dependence on optic flow information in older adults during walking was not found. Linear relations were observed between walking performance and flow speed as well as heading direction and flow asymmetry. The findings suggest that the ability to integrate optic flow information into the multimodal system for assessment of walking speed and heading direction is comparable in older and younger adults.
**Notes:**
	This article performed 3 different trials in order to determine if age changes how vision, optic flow, and lateral flow asymmetry effect a walking gait. 
	Trial 1: Manipulation of Vision
	This trial had both groups (undergraduates and older people approx. age 65) walk at a speed of 0.8 m/s in a normal environment, while blindfolded, and while in a VR hallway environment. This trial did show that in the older population there is a statistical significance for a reliance on vision for gait that is not present in the younger adults. This was measured by comparing the average stride frequency of the group in a real world environment and while blindfolded. 
	Trial 2: Manipulation of Optic Flow Speed
	This trial had both groups walking at a speed of 0.8 m/s while the environment had an optic flow of (0, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m/s). This trial showed no significant differences between groups in how their speed was effected by the optic flow. However there was significant decreases in gait speed and stride frequency for both groups.
	Trial 3: Manipulation of Lateral Flow Asymmetry
	This trial had both groups walking at a speed of 0.8 m/s while one visual field of the VR environment had an optic flow of -0.8 m/s and the other had an optic flow of (0, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m/s). There where no significant differences between how the groups reacted to this trial. However both groups had a significant drift away from the faster moving wall.

This study suggests that older adults do not have a greater dependence on vision for gait. The authors explain that the significant lower gait speed from the older adults while blindfolded is likely due to "changes in vestibular or somatosensory function or previous experiences, making them walk more cautiously."

**Highlights:**
- "Previous studies demonstrate that gait parameters are inadvertently modulated by manipulations of optic flow speed."
- "Clinically, the degree of flexibility in interlimb coordination has been found to correlate with bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson’s disease and with asymmetry in stroke. Older adults with risk for falls showed a reduced flexibility in their coordination of walking at speeds higher than 0.8 m/s compared with the walking patterns of healthy older adults."
- "Participants were trained to walk 8 m at 0.8 ± 0.05 m/s because the state of interlimb coordination at this walking speed is relatively unstable. Therefore, if there were any changes in coordination pattern as a result of changes in optic flow speed, it would be observed more sensitively."
- "There was no statistically significant difference between younger and older adults in visual dependency as measured by the rod and frame task, F(1, 31) = 0.68, p = .42."
- "Post hoc analyses revealed that a significant effect of Vision was observed in the older adults, F(2, 32) = 17.97, p = .0001, but not in the younger adults, F(2, 30) = 2.66, p = .09. Post hoc analyses of the vision effect in the older adults showed that walking speed in BF was significantly lower than that in EO (p = .0001) and VR (p = .006). Significant main effects for Vision, F(2, 62) = 12.38, p = .0001, and Group, F(1, 31) = 4.42, p = .05, were observed for stride frequency. Older adults had a significantly higher stride frequency (1.10 Hz) than the younger adults (1.03 Hz). Post hoc analyses revealed that stride frequency in BF (1.14 Hz) was significantly higher than that in EO (1.01 Hz, p = .001) and VR (1.05 Hz, p = .001)."
