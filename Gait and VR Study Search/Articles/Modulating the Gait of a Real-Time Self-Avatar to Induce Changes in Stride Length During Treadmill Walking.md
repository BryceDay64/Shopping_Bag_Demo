**Abstract:**
	In virtual reality, it is possible to simulate visual self-representation by mapping one’s body movements with an avatar. The acceptance of the virtual body as part of one’s own body creates an ownership illusion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of increasing a self-avatar’s stride length on the stride length of embodied users. Nine healthy subjects walked on a treadmill while viewing their self-avatar in a virtual mirror through an HMD, while the stride length of the avatar was manipulated. No statistically significant changes in stride length were found but the results show a clear trend towards a gradual increase in stride length following increased stride length of the avatar, and a residual after-effect.

**Notes:**
	This article has subjects use a head mounted display with a first person avatar in front of a mirror. The subjects were instructed to walk on a treadmill while in the virtual environment to gain familiarity and establish a baseline for their gait (8 minutes), and then the avatars gait would be modified by adding 5 or 10 degrees to the right hip flexion (5 minutes), then unmodified (3 minutes), then modified with angle that was not used in the first modified avatar (5 minutes), and then with an unmodified avatar (3 minutes). The study did not find a statistical significance in changes of stride length, but did see an increased trend in stride length after the modification.

**Highlights:**
- "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of increasing a self-avatar’s stride length on the stride length of embodied users."
- "No statistically significant changes in stride length were found but the results show a clear trend towards a gradual increase in stride length following increased stride length of the avatar, and a residual after-effect."
- Two different modulations were applied to the right hip: adding 5° and 10°.
- "Nevertheless, the results show that changing an embodied avatar’s gait can be used to predictably manipulate a user’s gait. The observed changes in stride length are small, a tendency towards an adaptation over the time of the applied modulations is noticeable."
